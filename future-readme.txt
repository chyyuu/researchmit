1 driver related thoughts
1.1 commutativity of driver (compare to syscall level)
1.2 synthesis of driver based on the spec of hardware (or auto produce the driver)
1.3 the interface between OS and driver (the spec of interface of driver/OS )
1.4 security of driver (based on commutativity?)
1.5 IO optimization of driver?
