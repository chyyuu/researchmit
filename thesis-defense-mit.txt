A major challenge in performance modeling of multicore processors is slow simulation speed. FPGAs provide a massively-parallel reconfigurable platform, ideal for speeding up processor simulations. FPGAs, however, are difficult to program, and the FPGA substrate is difficult to utilize efficiently. We present a novel modeling methodology which enables the generation of a high-performance, cycle-accurate simulator from a cycle-level specification of the target processor architecture. We describe Arete, a full-system multicore processor simulator, developed using our methodology. 
We present clear evidence that the use of simplified models to speedup simulations can lead to wrong conclusions. Through two experiments performed using both cycle-accurate and simplified models, we show that on one hand there are substantial quantitative and qualitative differences in results, and on the other, the results match quite well.

先感谢 老师和提供帮助的学生，有silas
在讲的时候，老师就在提问。讲到不到一半（debugging solution时），已经开始defense了，老师，学生轮番提问，答辩者积极为自己辩护。
这样讲了1小时20分钟，然后老师起来与学生站在前面，接受进一步的提问。当然主要是学生回答问题。
然后鼓掌通过！
